# Temperature-Monitoring-system
temperature monitoring system using only embedded c , using timer inturot and adc for potentiometer and lm35 temperture sensor
Simulation link for the setup and components :https://www.tinkercad.com/things/dqGtEnXdpUh
Note: the temperature sensor used in the simulation is tmp36 and the code in the simulation is designed for it while the code in main.c is designed for lm35
